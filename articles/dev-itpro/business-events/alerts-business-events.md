# Alerts as business events

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, there are two kinds of alerts that can be configured by users. These are change-based alerts and due date alerts. For more information about the alerts functionality, see [Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/alerts-overview).

The change-based alerts and due date alerts can be configured to send out a business event as a mechanism to notify or trigger external applications or systems. This allows alerts to participate in advanced user notification scenarios and also in business process integration across systems.

To configure an alert, the **Send externally** setting must be enabled. The business event for the change-based alert and/or the due date alert must also be active for the alert to be sent out as a business event. [Business event activation wiki]https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/business-events/home-page#activating-business-events explains the activation in detail.
